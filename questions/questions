Hi,
Please find the details below. 

1.     Decide if you want to support an interactive or fit predict process :- 
       Priyanka - Decided to built an interactive Prediction model. It conatins a flask UI in which the user can enter the values and post clicking on the 'Predict', you will get the prediction as "Candidate should be hired or not".

2.     Implement an application that serves predictions to users :- 
       Priyanka - All the file are present in the git. To execute the code, please read the Readme.md

3.     Describe or implement the required infrastructure for deploying your application :- 


4.     Provide a diagram describing the process
       Priyanka - I have attached 2 diagrams. 
       First diagram represents the complete architecture. 
       Second diagram represents the part of the Data model I have implemented.

5.     How do you track quality of the predictions?
